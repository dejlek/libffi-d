libffi binding for D
====================

libffi-d is a binding to the libffi foreign function
interface library. It allows you to invoke functions
that use various calling conventions dynamically.
Often, particularly in interpreters, it is necessary
to dynamically invoke a native function. This is
made possible with libffi(-d) as long as you know
the return type, parameter types, and the ABI.
